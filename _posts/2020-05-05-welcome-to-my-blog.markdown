Hi, my name is Elise Minto and as I'm sure you've already read, I'm a recent graduate of the University of Michigan. This website is a way for me to highlight my skills in programming and learn new tools while getting the chance to start a blog, which has always been in the back of my mind. It is a work in progress but I'm excited to see what I can turn it into. Thanks for visiting.
